Controls:
==============

The main controls are mouse-based, utilising Left-click (interacting & placing blocks), Right-click (play/pause), and Mousewheel-click (clear screen). 

Mousewheel scrolling defaults to block-placement size, although the bindings can be changed from the "Mousewheel Bind" menu.

Advanced:
==============

To configure rulesets & neighbourhoods, create a new 'Editor' from the menu. 

The Editor controls are Left-click (increment cell by 1), Right-click (decrement cell by 1), and Mousewheel-click (set to custom value).

In the editor, to see and/or modify the pre-set neighbourhood and rulesets, use the menu "Rule Config" > "Get Neighbourhood" or "Get Rule", which will populate the grid with the data you selected.

Rules that are in place on the grid can be exported, which can then be imported at a later time. These functions are available from the Editor's "Rule Config" menu.
